# FittsTappingTask

This android application allows University students to test whether a thumb, or index finger has better throughput on a mobile device utilizing Fitts' Law.

The ability to select thumb or index finger tests, instructions on how to complete the tasks, and logging of the user's completion times and error rates are all done for you. 

The experimenter selects which trial they want to have their user perform, and then the mobile device can be given to the user, who is prompted with instructions on how to complete the tasks via Activity classes.

Once the user has read through the instructions and confirmed their understanding, they are taken to an Activity which will log their data underneath the /data folder in Android Studio, where you can retain their results for further analysis to determine which device has better throughput.
